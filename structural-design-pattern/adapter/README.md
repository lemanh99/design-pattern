## Description

## Structure

## How to use

1. Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of
   your code.
2. Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be
   added to the superclass.
