| Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) | A class should have only one reason to change.                                                            | Separate responsibilities of a class to keep code manageable and maintainable.                            | Divide program components into classes, each with a specific task.                        | A `Customer` class should handle customer information only, not payment processing.                                        |
| Open/Closed Principle (OCP)           | Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. | Allow extending functionality through additions without modifying existing source code.                   | Use inheritance or interfaces to extend functionality without altering the original code. | A system has predefined shapes (circle, rectangle) and can add new shapes without modifying the original code.             |
| Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.      | Ensure that subclasses and base classes are substitutable, preventing issues when instances are replaced. | Subclasses should inherit from base classes without altering the base class's behavior.   | A `Square` can replace a `Rectangle` without altering the system's functionality.                                          |
| Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) | Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.                                     | Split interfaces into smaller ones, so classes implement only what they need.                             | Create specific interfaces for each class instead of a large, all-encompassing interface. | A `Scanner` class doesn't need to implement all methods from the `Machine` interface.                                      |
| Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.            | Reduce dependencies between high-level and low-level classes by using interfaces or abstract classes.     | Use interfaces or abstract classes to create abstractions that both modules can use.      | A high-level `DatabaseConnection` class doesn't directly depend on `MySQLDatabase` but relies on the `Database` interface. |
