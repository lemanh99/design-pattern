### Important:

> 1. Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you
     to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
> 2. Separates object construction from its representation

## How to use

1. Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor”.
2. Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for
   example, stone and wooden houses).
3. Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.
