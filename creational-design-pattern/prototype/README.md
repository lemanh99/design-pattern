### Important:

> 1. Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on
     their classes.
> 2. A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

## How to use

1. Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
2. Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their
   respective objects.
