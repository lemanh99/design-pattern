> 2. Capture and restore an object's internal state

## Description

## Structure

## How to use

1. Use the Memento pattern when you want to produce snapshots of the object’s state to be able to restore a previous state of the object.
2. Use the pattern when direct access to the object’s fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.
